1
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:38,948
How do you say "grilled cheese"?

2
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:53,111
<i>-Hello.
-Hi.</i>

3
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,494
<i>I'm on my way from the airport,</i>

4
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,843
<i>and the front desk won't
get me your room number.</i>

5
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:03,765
<i>What's your room number?</i>

6
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:09,356
<i>-403.
-See you in half an hour.</i>

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,617
<i>-Wait a second.
-What?</i>

8
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,803
<i>-Where are you?
-I'm here.</i>

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,378
I didn't say you could come here.

10
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:19,717
<i>Can I come there?</i>

11
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:24,423
OK.

12
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:26,101
<i>I'll see you in half an hour.</i>

13
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:20,566
What's this music?

14
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,572
How did you find me?

15
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,004
It wasn't actually that hard.

16
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:51,129
Are you going to take a bath?

17
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,208
It's for you.

18
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:58,918
What got you here?

19
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:02,472
Bar in the lobby.

20
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:21,884
What the fuck is going on?

21
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,476
How long have you been
at this hotel now?

22
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,021
I don't know.

23
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:40,591
More than a week?

24
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,276
More than a week.

25
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,225
More than a month?

26
00:05:47,877 --> 00:05:49,088
More than a month.

27
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,202
How much does it cost?

28
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:57,957
I think around
750 million euros or something.

29
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:03,379
How long are you gonna stay?

30
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,507
How long do you wanna stay?

31
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,060
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

32
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,569
I think it's time for you to go home.

33
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,123
Probably.

34
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:40,619
Are you running away from me?

35
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,535
I thought I already did.

36
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,354
Would you order me
a Bloody Mary, please?

37
00:07:33,224 --> 00:07:35,248
Two Bloody Maries, please.

38
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,470
Have you slept with anyone?

39
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,147
No.

40
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:44,791
Have you?

41
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:49,756
No.

42
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,461
That was a long pause.

43
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:03,688
-I guess it doesn't really matter.
-No, it doesn't.

44
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,096
You got bruises on your body.

45
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,900
Whatever happens in the end,
I don't wanna lose you as my friend.

46
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,272
I promise...

47
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,329
I will never be your friend...

48
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,798
no matter what.

49
00:09:35,137 --> 00:09:35,892
Ever.

50
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,434
We fuck, then I'll feel
like shit tomorrow.

51
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,379
That's OK with me.

52
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:08,321
I love you.

53
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,781
I never hurt you on purpose.

54
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,265
I don't care.

55
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,522
Wanna see my view of Paris?

56
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,023
OK.
